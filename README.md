# Jura-Impressa-S70-esphome
Make Jura Impressa S70 - S75 - S85 - S9 - S90 -S95 - X70 - X90 - X95 models smart :)

Jura communication function taken in entirety from cmd2jura.ino, found at https://github.com/hn/jura-coffee-machine.

Much gratitude to https://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Enabled-Coffee-Machine/ for figuring out how these bits are stored.

After long reading on https://community.home-assistant.io/t/control-your-jura-coffee-machine/26604 managed to assemble esphome and send commands to machine.
But cannot get feedback from machine to esp.

I recently found this forum on german and finally managed to get status from machine: https://knx-user-forum.de/forum/projektforen/edomi/1010532-kaffeeautomaten-jura-bremer-aehnliche
